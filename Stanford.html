		<li>Speaking of the campus and its architecture, it is absolutely <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS792US792&biw=754&bih=744&tbm=isch&sxsrf=ACYBGNQ3tp0Q2vHMOcv2w3auHHnS_JfE2Q%3A1569903037008&sa=1&ei=vdGSXbEJrOf9BoC4uOAK&q=stanford+university+&oq=stanford+university+&gs_l=img.3..35i39j0i67j0l8.8200.8200..8454...0.0..0.72.72.1......0....1..gws-wiz-img.XgEUEMTjwIs&ved=0ahUKEwjx2-jGmPrkAhWsc98KHQAcDqwQ4dUDCAc&uact=5" target="_blank">beautiful.</a></li>
	</ul>

<h4>...Weird Facts</h4>
<ul>
<li>Full Moon is celebrated on campus.  Although the event is less formal now (usually including music and performances) female freshman would traditionally line up as male seniors would kiss them and give them a rose.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sad Facts/Cons</h4>
<li>Distance from Gracie: 42 hour drive
<ul>
	<li>Note: I realize that this might be a pro for you, but it had to be said.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>As much as I joke and complain, and as lowkey (highkey?) sad as I would be, I really hope you get into Stanford, Robert.  This university looks amazing, and I know you would do amazing here.
(Note: you would also do amazing at NCSU, but I guess you'd be missing out on Full Moon kisses.)  Anyway, regardless of the fact that you'll still have to endure my annoying bickering, I hope you
know that you deserve the best school, and that I hope you get in and everything goes perfect.  I expect you to design something beautiful in the future.
